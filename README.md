# Intro

Build your QML app from scaffold.

LK QtQuick Scaffold provides some built-in themes (aka Qml components library), and a powerful Python backend manager for you.

Some significant features showed below:

- Easily register python functions to Qml context
- A decorator for translating QObject to PyObject, you can use something like `PyObject.border.width` to access the `border.width` property in Python
- The themes' widgets are finely designed, full filled with animations and easy to use
